GetItDone
=========

GetItDone is an MVC.Net application aimed at forcing the user to work in a GTD way. Unlike other applications that allow you to design your own workflow around the app, which then basically serves as a list of lists, GetItDone makes you follow the workflow that David Allen prescribes in his book, at least as interpreted by me.
